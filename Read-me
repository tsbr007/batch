8. DB2 Configuration and Notes
Ensure that the DB2 server is running on the given localhost:50000 with the correct credentials (username and password).
You can replace mydb with the actual database name, and update the username and password accordingly.
Make sure the db2jcc4.jar (DB2 JDBC Driver) is available in your Maven repository, or manually download and add it to your local Maven setup.

How It Works:
The /batch/start endpoint triggers the Spring Batch job.
The batch job reads from in-memory items (SampleData), processes them (logging), and writes (logging).
Job metadata (such as job execution status) is stored in the DB2 database, thanks to Spring Batch using the JobRepository backed by DB2.
How to Run:
Ensure DB2 is up and running and accessible with the connection details you provide in the application.properties.
Run the Spring Boot application.
Access http://localhost:8080/batch/start to trigger the batch job.
This setup can be customized further based on more complex business logic, or extended with additional steps such as reading/writing to DB2 within the batch processing itself.
